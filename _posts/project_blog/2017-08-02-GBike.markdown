description: "Gandhinagar Urban Development Authority(GUDA) has initiated a community bike sharing system in Gandhinagar.
             Around ten, cycle pick-up and drop stands have been set up from where people can take the bike and return it to any
             of the stand after the use. I worked in a team of 4 members to build a digital log maintenance system (as my summer             1
             design project). It involved back-end and web development for the proper management of cycle for the stand person and
             the supervisor from the administrator side.I worked as the back-end developer and created database for the system."
