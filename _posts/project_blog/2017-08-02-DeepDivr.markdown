description: "DeepDivr is a data analytics Project. It is very difficult to visualize any data in numbers. So in this project, I tried to
              develop framework in which user can query in their natural language and can get output in graphs. The graph may be
              Bar graph, Line graph and the decision tree. We have integrated different layers like NLP layer, Module Decider layer,
              Graph plotting layer. The whole dataset is converted into graph database(using neo4j) which further helped in developing
              more functionality for our data since in graph database every node connected using edges."
